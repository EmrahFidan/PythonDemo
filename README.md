<h2 style="color: #4cc9f0;"> Lessons Learned </h1>

After C, syntax came very easily and the biggest reason it is the most popular language is that I think it is so easily written.

Being so easy to write means a lot of mistakes can be made and I made a lot of line errors while writing my codes

Libraries should be used without losing much time with syntax, as we can use Python in so many areas that we should proceed faster.
