This project is the project folder that I am using to learn the Python syntax, with examples of basic and intermediate projects.


<h2 style="color: #ffa500;"> Features </h1>

Some of the key features of this project include the following:

- Clean code: The project has paid particular attention to writing clean and readable code. The code has been developed with comprehensibility and maintainability in mind.
- Learning Code (LC): This project has been designed as a resource for those who want to learn the software development process. The code examples and instructions used in the project are designed to support your learning process.
- Udemy Course Tracks: During the development of this project, the Udemy course "Python from Zero to Advanced" was used. You can access the course [here] (https://www.udemy.com/course/sifirdan-ileri-seviyeye-python/).

<h2 style="color: #4cc9f0;"> Lessons Learned </h1>

After C, syntax came very easily and the biggest reason it is the most popular language is that I think it is so easily written.

Being so easy to write means a lot of mistakes can be made and I made a lot of line errors while writing my codes

Libraries should be used without losing much time with syntax, as we can use Python in so many areas that we should proceed faster.
